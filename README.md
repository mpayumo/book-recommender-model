The **goal** of this project is to demonstrate the applicability of matrix factorization and deep learning when modeling and developing a recommender systemâ€”in this case, a **book recommender system**. It utilizes the dataset that was collected by [Cai-Nicolas Ziegler](http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~cziegler/BX/WWW-2005-Preprint.pdf) during a four-week crawl (Aug. to Sep. 2004) of the Book Crossing community.

## Data Source

> ### The dataset comes in three CSV files that separately contain the following:

<ul>
    <li>User demographic information</li>
    <li>Book ratings</li>
    <li>Book titles along with author, publisher, publication, ISBN, etc. </li>
</ul>

## Tech Stack

> ### The following were used in the development of the recommender system:

<ul>
    <li>Python</li>
    <li>JupyterLab</li>
    <li>Amazon Web Services</li>
    <li>Git</li>
<!--     <li></li> -->
</ul>
